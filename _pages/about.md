<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Associate Professor and Master Supervisor at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.ecnu.edu.cn/), [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/). 
I was selected for the Shanghai Youth Science and Technology Rising Star Program (‰∏äÊµ∑Â∏ÇÈùíÂπ¥ÁßëÊäÄÂêØÊòéÊòüËÆ°Âàí) in 2023.
My research interests primarily focus on foundational issues in NLP and AI for medicine and education, such as Large Language Models, clinical NLP, and AI-assisted education. 
I completed my Ph.D. at the [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)](https://ir.hit.edu.cn/) in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Wanxiang Che](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~car/). 
Also, I had worked as a algorithm engineer intern at [Tencent Jarvis Lab](https://jarvislab.tencent.com/) during my Ph.D.
From 2022 to 2024, I was a young researcher at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), working on the large language model for the medical domain.
