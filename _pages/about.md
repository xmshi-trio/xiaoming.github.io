<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Associate Researcher and Master Supervisor at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.ecnu.edu.cn/), [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/). 
I was selected for the Shanghai Youth Science and Technology Rising Star Program (上海市青年科技英才扬帆计划) in 2023.
My research interests primarily focus on foundational issues in NLP and AI for medicine and education, such as Large Language Models, clinical NLP, and AI-assisted education. 
I completed my Ph.D. at the [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)](https://ir.hit.edu.cn/) in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Wanxiang Che](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~car/). 
Also, I had worked as a algorithm engineer intern at [Tencent Jarvis Lab](https://jarvislab.tencent.com/) during my Ph.D, under the supervision of [Yefeng Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vAIECxgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
From 2022 to 2024, I was an associate researcher at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), working on the large language model for the medical domain.
